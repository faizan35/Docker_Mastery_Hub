# 1.3 Creating your first Docker container

In this section, you'll learn how to create and run your first Docker container.

## 1.3.1 Building and Running first Docker Container

#### 1. Find a project

- ToDo Project in Node.js, clone it in your machine.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/faizan35/todo-app-node.git
  ```

#### 2. **Dockerfile**

- Inside the project dir.

  ```bash
  touch Dockerfile
  ```

- Dockerfiles as scripts containing instructions to build a Docker image. Write script into the file.

  ```Dockerfile
  # base image with node js
  FROM node:18.18-alpine

  # Working dir with all the code
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy code src to des
  COPY . .

  # Install packages
  RUN npm install

  # app is ready

  # Run the container with args
  CMD ["node","app.js"]
  ```

#### 3. Build the Docker Image

- Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile, and run:
  ```bash
  docker build -t node-app .
  ```

#### 4. Run the Container

- Once the image is built, you can run a container based on that image:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-app:latest
  ```
- The `-d` flag runs the container in the background (detached mode), and `-p` maps a port on your host machine to a port in the container.

#### 5. View Running Containers

- To see a list of running containers, use:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

#### 6. Stop and Remove Containers

- To stop a running container, use:
  ```bash
  docker stop container_id_or_name
  ```
  - To see a list of stoped containers, use:
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```
- To remove a container, use:

  ```bash
  docker rm container_id_or_name
  ```
