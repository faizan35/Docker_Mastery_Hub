# 5. Docker Image Optimization and Efficiency

## 5.1. Image Layering Concept with Dockerfile

Docker images are built using a layered file system.

1.  The Docker image starts with a read-only **base layer**, which serves as the foundation.
2.  As instructions in the Dockerfile (such as RUN, COPY, ADD) are executed, new **read-only layers are added** on top of the base image for each instruction.
3.  The final layer added is the writable **"container layer"**, where any changes made during the container's runtime are stored.

### 5.1.1. Impact of layer caching on Docker build performance

When you build an image, Docker caches each layer so that if there is no changes in the Dockerfile a it can reuse the cached layer instead of rebuilding it. This speeds up the build process significantly.

### 5.1.2. Techniques for minimizing the number of layers and optimizing layer reuse

To minimize the number of layers and optimize layer reuse in Docker images, consider the following techniques:

1.  **Combine Commands in RUN Instructions**: Rather than executing multiple commands in separate RUN instructions, combine them into a single instruction. Each RUN instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, so minimizing the number of RUN instructions reduces the number of layers in the final image.

    ```Dockerfile
    # Bad practice - each command creates a new layer
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get install -y package1
    RUN apt-get install -y package2

    # Good practice - combine commands into a single RUN instruction
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y package1 package2
    ```

2.  **Clean Up After Each RUN Instruction**: Remove any unnecessary files or artifacts created during each RUN instruction to keep the layer size minimal. This ensures that each layer contains only essential files, reducing the overall image size.

    ```Dockerfile
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y package1 && \
        apt-get clean
    ```

3.  **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Utilize multi-stage builds to separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies. This approach allows you to use one stage to build and compile your application, and then copy only the necessary artifacts to the final stage, minimizing the final image size.

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM base_image AS builder
    RUN ... # Build and compile application

    FROM base_image
    COPY --from=builder /app /app # Copy built artifacts
    ```

4.  **Avoid Unnecessary COPY or ADD Instructions**: Only copy essential files and directories into the image using the COPY or ADD instruction. Minimize the scope of these instructions to reduce the number of layers created.

    ```Dockerfile
    COPY src /app/src # Only copy necessary source files
    ```

## 5.2. Techniques for Minimizing Image Size

1.  **Alpine Linux Base**: Use Alpine Linux as the base image for smaller footprint.
2.  **Multi-stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime environments to reduce final image size.
3.  **Minimize Layers**: Combine commands to reduce the number of layers.
4.  **.dockerignore**: Exclude unnecessary files with .dockerignore.
5.  **Optimize Dependency Management**: Use package managers with `--no-cache` to reduce image size.
6.  **Compress Assets**: Compress static assets before adding them to the image.
7.  **Remove Unnecessary Files**: Clean up temporary files and caches in the Dockerfile.
8.  **Use Smaller Runtimes**: Opt for smaller runtime images like `node:alpine` or `python:alpine`.
9.  **Review Image Layers**: Analyze and refactor Dockerfile to minimize large or unnecessary layers.
10. **Leverage Docker BuildKit**: Utilize Docker BuildKit for cache management and parallel execution.

## 5.3. Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Builds

There are two stages in Multi-Stage Build, **Build Stage** and **Runtime Stage**.

### Step 1: Identify Build Dependencies

Identify the dependencies required to build your application. These may include compilers, libraries, and build tools.

### Step 2: Define Build Stage

- This stage is responsible for compiling, building, and preparing the application or its artifacts.
- It often starts with a base image containing **build tools** and dependencies necessary for this process.
- Once everything is compiled or installed we dont need build tools in Runtime Stage.

  ```Dockerfile
  # Stage 1: Build stage
  FROM python:3.9 AS builder

  WORKDIR /app

  COPY requirements.txt ./
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  COPY . .
  ```

- By using `AS builder` (or any other name), we give a meaningful name to the first stage.
- Naming the build stage allows us to reference it later when copying artifacts to subsequent stages.

#### Step 2: Define Runtime Stage

- This stage is where the application or service is executed.
- It typically starts with a clean and small base image **that only includes the runtime dependencies** needed to run the application.
- Copy the necessary files (including the installed dependencies) from the build stage (`--from=builder`) into this stage.
- Keeping the resulting final image size minimal.

  ```Dockerfile
  # Stage 2: Runtime stage
  FROM python:3.9-slim

  WORKDIR /app

  COPY --from=builder /app .

  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```
